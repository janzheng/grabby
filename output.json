Rob is a Matthew Flinders Fellow in Bioinformatics, College of Science and Engineering.\nRob received his BSc (Hons) from De Montfort University, Leicester, England, and then completed a PhD at the Nitrogen Fixation Laboratory at the University of Sussex, England exploring the regulation of nitrogen fixation in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_. He moved to the US as a PostDoc, first at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia studying enterotoxigenic _E. coli_, and then at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign studying the genomics and pathogenesis of _Salmonella_, work that he continued as an Assistant Professor at the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center in Memphis, TN._ _Working with Argonne National Labs and the Fellowship for the Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) he developed the RAST and MG-RAST systems for bacterial genome and metagenome annotation.\nIn 2006, Rob took a position in the Departments of Computer Science and Biology at San Diego State University, and his work there led to breakthroughs in our understanding of how viruses interact with their hosts, and how viruses from around the world carry important genetic information. Rob has continued to push current sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, in 2013 took a next-generation sequencing machine to the remote Southern Line Islands to explore metagenomics of coral reefs in real-time. In 2014 Rob’s team identified a virus that is present in the intestines of approximately half the people in the world, and in 2019 Rob assembled a consortium of 115 colleagues from every continent to demonstrate the global spread of the virus.\nIn addition to science and teaching Rob is also an advanced scientific SCUBA diver having led teams to study Coral Reefs all over the world. In his spare time, he is a cyclist, black-diamond skiier and an avid international yachtsman, navigating in long-distance offshore races, including navigating the 2019 TransPac race from Los Angeles to Honolulu finishing 4th out of 89 boats.\n","Editable Form Link":{"label":"Form Edit

Ameneh, BHB, MBChB, DipPaeds, MD, FRACP, is a senior lecturer in Child and Adolescent Health for The University of Sydney, based at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead where she also works as a paediatric infectious diseases specialist.\nHer research focus is on novel therapeutic options for difficult to treat infections in paediatrics and optimisation of antimicrobial therapy for children with cystic fibrosis. She was the first clinician in Australia to treat a child with intravenous phage therapy in October 2019 for a highly resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ bone infection and has been overseeing the planning and treatment of other patients using phages against _Mycobacterium abscessus_ (including the first use of a genetically modified phage in Australia) through collaborations with Prof Iredell and the Westmead Institute for Medical Research and the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network cystic fibrosis teams.\nAmeneh is the paediatric representative for the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network with a goal to increase involvement of children in clinical research, particularly early phase studies. She is also the Phage Therapy content expert for the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network Advanced Therapeutics Steering Committee. Her other areas of research include investigating the immunological response to influenza and COVID-19 vaccination in healthcare workers, the burden of enteric fever in Western Sydney and improving

Jennifer is Director of Biobanking with NSW Health Pathology and conjoint Professor of Molecular Oncology in the Faculty of Medicine and Health at the University of Sydney.\nShe has spent much of her scientific career analysing childhood and adult cancers at a molecular level. Has published over 100 peer-reviewed publications, which have been cited more than 3,200 times. Her current research interests include the analysis of human biobank research outputs and the identification of predictors of biobank success, and the detection and analysis of incorrectly reported nucleotide sequence reagents in the biomedical research literature. Professor Byrne was named as one of the journal Nature’s “10 people who mattered in 2017”, for identifying and reporting numerous flawed cancer research papers.\n[USyd

Phages are collected for study from local waterways in partnership with the [Wurrundjeri Woi wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation](https://www.wurundjeri.com.au/). Research activity (documented on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=JObeofQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)) is enhanced through collaborative international Biobanks of phages and clinical bacterial isolates in the [UK](https://www.monash.edu/international/monash-warwick/researchers/our-research-projects/phage-therapy) and [China](https://www.amr.gov.au/activity-and-research-directory/activity-and-research-directory-projects/monash-bdi-wmu-alliance). Detailed investigation into the biology of the new waves of _Klebsiella_ currently spreading across the globe relies on comparative genomics, biochemical characterization and evaluation of bacterial membrane proteins, and multi-‘omics assessments of these bacteria.\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/trevorlithgow?lang=en)\n","Editable Form Link":{"label":"Form Edit
